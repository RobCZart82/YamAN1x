# Free-running ITU counter events

New H8ItuFreeRunning composes the monotonic counter and H8H latch for the
restricted cycle65536 internal-clock profile. Absolute tick-distance crossings
set compareA/B and overflow flags even when interrupts are disabled. TGRFFFF
compares at wrapped target0. Polling reads settle elapsed time;count/compare/
enable/status changes settle old state first. Invalid configuration/index/time
rejects without mutation. No IRQ callbacks,deadlines,auto-clear,capture or MMIO.
Independent per-tick oracle covers262144 initial/target cases;2064 divider/phase/
split cases,disabled polling/clear/reenable/stop and uint64 limits tested.
A locked unchanged original update_counter harness compares131072 free-running
value/flag cases with two TGRs and IER0. No original code saved in repository.
Counter exposes pure elapsed_ticks to share overflow-safe time conversion.
Next:auto-clear event semantics/boundaries if needed,then bounded deadlines and
IRQ dispatch before bus start. Firmware still stopsFFFF60;no boot/audio proof.
Own CI/review pending.

Reproduce original value/flag differential:

```sh
python3 tools/check_itu_events_reference.py --archive /path/to/mame-master.zip
```

Scope is the cycle65536 internal-clock profile with IRQ disabled in the original
harness;not general timer mode,timing of delivered IRQs or physical hardware.
